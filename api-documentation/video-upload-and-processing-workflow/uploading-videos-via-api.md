# Uploading Videos via API

## Overview

The AiKYNETIX API allows both regular users and administrators to initiate video processing sessions. Whether youâ€™re uploading for personal analysis or acting on behalf of another user, the API provides dedicated endpoints for each activity type (Running, Jumping, and Weightlifting). Once a video is uploaded, the system creates a session resource that triggers the processing pipeline.

### Prerequisites

Before uploading a video, ensure that you have:

* **Valid API Credentials:**\
  All requests must include a valid API-KEY token in the `Authorization` header. For example:

```
Authorization: API-KEY <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
```

* **Appropriate Permissions:**
  * **Regular Users:** Can upload videos directly to create their own session.
  * **Administrators/Sub-Admins:** May upload on behalf of another user. In these cases, the request must include an additional `user_id` parameter.
* **Multipart/Form-Data Format:**\
  Video uploads are performed using a `multipart/form-data` POST request. Your request should include the raw video file along with any additional parameters required by the endpoint.

### Upload Endpoints Overview

Depending on the activity type and user role, use one of the following endpoints:

<details>

<summary><a href="../developer-resources-and-api-reference/api-reference/running.md">Running Sessions</a></summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary><a href="../developer-resources-and-api-reference/api-reference/weightlifting.md">Weightlifting Sessions</a></summary>

* [**Regular User Upload**](../developer-resources-and-api-reference/api-reference/weightlifting.md#weightlifting-sessions)**:**\
  **Endpoint:** `POST /weightlifting/sessions/`\

  **Endpoint:** `POST /weightlifting/management/sessions/`\
  **Parameters:**
  * **user\_id (string, required)**
  * **video (file, required)**

  * **session\_name (string, optional)**
  * **barbell\_mass (string, optional**

</details>

### Request Payload & Multipart/Form-Data Requirements

When constructing your upload request, ensure that you:

* Set the **Content-Type** header to `multipart/form-data`.
* Include the **video file** as a binary field.
* Pass additional parameters as form fields:
  * For admin-initiated uploads, include the `user_id` field.
  * For weightlifting sessions, include `exercise_name` (and optionally `barbell_mass`).
  * Optionally, include a descriptive `session_name` to help identify your session.

#### Example cURL Command (Admin Upload for a Jumping Session)

```
curl -X POST \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'Authorization: API-KEY <YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
     -F 'user_id=someUserId123' \
     -F 'video=@/path/to/video.mp4' \
     -F 'session_name=Custom Jump Session' \
     -F 'incline_degree=5' \
     https://aikpy-nsz2.onrender.com/jumping/management/sessions/
```

***

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Authentication:**\
   The client sends the request with a valid API-KEY token. For admin uploads, the additional `user_id` is also provided.
2. **File Upload & Session Creation:**\
   The video file, along with any extra form data, is transmitted to the server. The API then creates a new processing session for the video.
3. **Server Response:**\
   On success, the API responds with a JSON object containing:
   * **session\_id:** A unique identifier for the new session.
   * **title:** The session title (either user-specified or a fallback).
4. **Next Steps:**\
   The returned `session_id` can be used to:
   * Poll for processing status.
   * Retrieve the analyzed video.
   * Access detailed session metrics and analysis reports via subsequent API calls.

***

### Handling the Response

A successful upload response will resemble the following JSON:

```
{
  "session_id": "abcd1234efgh5678",
  "title": "Custom Session"
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If the upload fails due to missing fields, invalid token, or insufficient permissions, the response will contain an `error` field with an appropriate message
{% endhint %}

> **Note:** For details on parameters, request/response formats, and error handling, please see the respective sections in our [API Reference](broken-reference).
