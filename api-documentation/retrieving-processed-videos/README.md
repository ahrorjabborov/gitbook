# 🎞️ Retrieving Processed Videos

Once a video has been processed by our system, you can retrieve the final processed video along with its analysis data using our API. This section is divided into three subpages that provide detailed guidance on each aspect:

* [**Retrieval API Endpoints**](retrieval-api-endpoints.md)\
  Learn how to use our endpoints to fetch processed videos and their associated metrics. This page details the request formats, required parameters, and sample responses for efficient data retrieval.
* [**Handling Delays & Errors**](handling-delays-and-errors.md)\
  Discover best practices for managing delays and errors during the retrieval process. This page explains common error responses, troubleshooting steps, and strategies to re-initiate retrieval if processing delays occur.
