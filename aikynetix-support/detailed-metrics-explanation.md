# ðŸ§­ Detailed Metrics Explanation

In this section, you'll find detailed definitions of the key performance metrics used by AiKYNETIX. These metrics provide quantitative insights into your performance across different activitiesâ€”Running, Jumping, and Weightliftingâ€”allowing you to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and optimize your training.

<summary>Running Metrics</summary>

#### Speed

**Definition:** Speed is measured in meters (or feet) per second. It reflects how fast you are moving during your run.

#### Incline / Elevation Gain

**Definition:** Elevation gain represents the percentage change in your vertical position, measured in meters (or feet). It indicates how much you are climbing during a run.

#### Ground Contact Time (GCT)

**Definition:** Ground Contact Time is the duration (in seconds) that your foot remains in contact with the ground during each step cycle. Shorter GCT typically indicates a more efficient, faster stride.

#### Flight Time

**Definition:** Flight time measures the duration during which both feet are off the ground. As you reach your top speed, flight time tends to decrease.

#### Cadence

**Definition:** Cadence is the number of steps per minute (spm), also known as step rate or frequency. A cadence above 150 spm is generally considered optimal for efficiency.

#### Mechanical Running Power (W)

**Definition:** Mechanical running power quantifies the power generated by muscles and tendons during running. It is lower than metabolic power due to muscle and tendon efficiency limitations. This metric helps tailor pacing strategies and monitor training intensity.

#### Contact Angle

**Definition:** Ground Contact Angle is formed between a line from your center of mass to the point of ground contact and the horizontal. An angle close to 90Â° is ideal for optimal force application and energy efficiency.

#### Foot Strike

**Definition:** Foot strike describes the manner in which your foot makes contact with the ground (heel, midfoot, or forefoot). Understanding your foot strike can inform shoe selection, gait adjustments, and injury prevention strategies.

#### Pace

**Definition:** Pace is expressed as the time it takes to cover a specified distance (e.g., minutes per kilometer or mile). It is a direct measure of running efficiency.

#### Balance

**Definition:** Balance refers to the symmetry in ground contact time between the right and left sides. A balanced GCT within the 48â€“52% range ensures even force distribution and reduces injury risk.

#### Normalized Power

**Definition:** Normalized Power measures the mechanical energy used to move 1 kg of body weight 1 meter in the direction of running. It is expressed in J/(kgÂ·m) or W/(kgÂ·m/s) and indicates running efficiencyâ€”the lower the value, the more efficient the performance.

#### Stride Length

**Definition:** Stride Length is the average distance covered in a single stride (from the initial contact of one foot to the next contact of the same foot). It directly affects running efficiency and energy usage.

#### Joint Angles

**Definition:** Joint angles refer to the degree of bend at various body joints during running. Two key metrics include:

* **Takeoff Knee Extension (Â°):** The knee angle at the moment your foot leaves the ground; a lower angle is often associated with better performance.
* **Takedown Eversion Velocity (Â°/s):** The speed at which the rear foot moves during ground contact; values closer to zero are preferred.

#### Timing of Peak Dorsiflexion (%)

**Definition:** This metric indicates the percentage of the stance phase spent in dorsiflexion. A longer dorsiflexion phase in beginner runners can facilitate elastic energy storage for more efficient movement.

#### Stride Angle (Â°)

**Definition:** Stride angle is the angle between the tangent of the foot's theoretical arc during a stride and the ground. A higher stride angle can contribute to improved performance.

#### FPS

**Definition:** FPS is the video frame rate (frames per second) captured in the AiKYNETIX App, which impacts the precision of the metric calculations.

<summary>Jumping Metrics</summary>

#### Ground Reaction Force (GRF)

**Definition:** GRF is the total force exerted on the ground during a jump, measured in Newtons (N). It reflects the combined forces of vertical and horizontal propulsion.

#### Braking (Eccentric) Phase

**Definition:** This metric monitors the rate at which muscles stretch before a jump, preparing for the explosive concentric action.

#### Reactive Strength Index (RSI)

**Definition:** RSI measures the ability to quickly transition from the braking to the push-off phase. It is calculated by dividing jump height by ground contact time.

#### Push-Off

**Definition:** Push-Off evaluates the speed and strength of the muscle contraction that propels you upward during a jump.

#### Contraction Time

**Definition:** This is the total time taken by the muscles to stretch and then contract during a jump, indicating overall explosive strength.

#### Flight Time

**Definition:** Flight time measures the duration you are airborne during a jump, which directly influences jump height.

#### COM Velocity at Takeoff

**Definition:** This metric quantifies how quickly your center of mass (COM) moves at the moment of takeoff, contributing to jump height and distance.

#### Jump Height

**Definition:** Jump height is the vertical distance achieved during the jump. It is a primary indicator of lower-body explosive power.

#### Maximum GRF at Takeoff

**Definition:** This is the peak force exerted against the ground at the moment of takeoff, reflecting the explosive power of your jump.

#### Maximum GRF at Landing

**Definition:** This metric captures the peak force absorbed during landing, which is crucial for assessing impact and potential injury risk.

#### Peak Power

**Definition:** Peak Power measures the maximum power output during the jump, indicating overall athletic performance.

#### Normalized Power

**Definition:** Normalized Power adjusts the power output relative to effort variations, providing a consistent measure of energy efficiency during jumps.

#### Knee Angle at End of Eccentric Phase

**Definition:** This metric records the knee flexion angle just before you initiate the jump, which is critical for maximizing force production while minimizing joint stress.

<summary>Weightlifting Metrics</summary>

#### Max Bar Speed

**Definition:** Max Bar Speed indicates the highest speed reached by the barbell during a lift, reflecting explosive strength and movement efficiency.

#### Max Ground Reaction Force (GRF)

**Definition:** Max GRF is the peak force exerted against the ground during a lift. This metric is key for assessing stability and the effective application of force.

#### Max Power

**Definition:** Max Power measures the highest power output during the lift. It combines speed and strength to provide a comprehensive performance indicator.

#### Total Time

**Definition:** Total Time captures the complete duration of the lift, from start to finish, helping assess the overall efficiency of the movement.

#### Bar Past the Knee Acceleration

**Definition:** This metric measures the acceleration of the barbell as it passes the knees. It is an indicator of how quickly the athlete can increase bar speed in the initial phase of the lift.

#### Bar Past the Knee Speed

**Definition:** Bar Past the Knee Speed reflects the velocity of the barbell as it passes the knees, offering insights into the effectiveness of the initial pull.

#### Catch Time

**Definition:** Catch Time is the duration between the barbell reaching its highest point and the athlete securing it in the bottom position. This metric is important for evaluating the athlete's technique and timing.
