# ðŸ“¹ Best Practices for Recording Videos

### General Recommendations

* **High Resolution & Frame Rate:**\
  Record videos in at least 1080p resolution. For dynamic movements, aim for a frame rate of 30â€“60 fps to capture smooth motion and finer details.
* **Stable Setup:**\
  Use a tripod or stable mounting to avoid camera shake. Consistent framing ensures that key movements remain in view throughout the recording.
* **Consistent Lighting:**\
  Record in well-lit conditions with minimal shadows. Natural daylight or uniform artificial lighting helps maintain clarity, reducing noise and motion blur.
* **Appropriate Video Format:**\
  Use standard formats (e.g., MP4) that are compatible with our API. Ensure your files arenâ€™t overly compressed to preserve detail.
* **Clear Background:**\
  Choose a simple, uncluttered background to minimize distractions. This allows the processing algorithms to focus on the subjectâ€™s movement.
* **Proper Clothing & Footwear:**\
  Wear form-fitting athletic wear and proper shoes to clearly delineate body movements. Avoid loose clothing that can obscure joint angles and posture.
