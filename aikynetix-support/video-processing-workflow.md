# üìΩÔ∏è Video Processing Workflow

After your video is uploaded, the AiKYNETIX system automatically kicks off a multi-stage processing workflow to generate valuable insights from your content. This process ensures that every video is rigorously analyzed and transformed into actionable data. Below is an outline of the complete workflow:

1. **Receive & Validate Video**
   * The server receives your uploaded video file.
   * The system verifies the file's integrity and format before storing it.
2. **Queue Video for Processing**
   * Once validated, the video is added to a processing queue to await further analysis.
3. **Frame Extraction**
   * The video is broken down into individual frames for detailed analysis.
4. **Frame Preprocessing**
   * Each extracted frame is preprocessed (e.g., resized, normalized) to ensure optimal conditions for analysis.
5. **Processing Algorithms**
   * Specialized algorithms analyze the preprocessed frames for features and performance metrics.
6. **Generate Processed Video & Metrics**
   * A new, processed version of your video is created alongside detailed performance metrics.
7. **Store Results**
   * Both the processed video and its metrics are securely stored for later retrieval.
8. **User Notification**
   * The system notifies you that processing has started by providing a Job ID for tracking.
   * Once processing is complete, you can review comprehensive reports and analytics.
