# ⏬ Understanding Processed Video Outputs

Once a video has been processed, AiKYNETIX delivers comprehensive outputs that empower you to assess performance and make informed decisions. Each session’s output comprises:

* **Metrics:**\
  Both raw and analyzed metrics are provided. These include detailed numerical values that capture aspects of your performance. Metrics are tailored for each activity type, offering insights such as average speed, cadence, jump height, flight duration, and more.\
  See this [section](detailed-metrics-explanation.md) for detailed list of metrics.
*   **Summary Report:**\
    The summary report consolidates key performance data in a user-friendly format. It features:

    * Charts and graphical representations that compare your metrics with established normal ranges.
    * An expandable feedback section offering general observations and personalized recommendations.
    * Direct comparisons between sessions, helping you track progress over time.

    To find out how to read reports head down to [section](how-to-read-and-interpret-summaries-and-reports.md) about them.
* **Recommendations:**\
  Leveraging advanced analytics and generative AI, the system provides actionable recommendations. These suggestions are based on your specific performance data and are aimed at enhancing your technique and overall outcomes. You can see this [section](how-recommendations-are-generated.md) to find out how recommendations are generated as well as examples.
* **Activity-Specific Analysis:**\
  In addition to the general outputs, specialized analyses are available for each activity:
  * **Running:** Detailed gait analysis reports.
  * **Weightlifting:** Comprehensive lift analysis with metrics on bar speed, power, and control.
  * **Jumping:** An in-depth jump analysis report.

### Jumping Session Processed Outputs

Jumping sessions, for example, yield a rich summary report that highlights various aspects of your vertical jump performance. Here’s what you can expect from a jumping summary:

* **Summary Overview:**\
  At the top, an expandable feedback window provides general observations on your jump performance (e.g., “Great consistency in jump height, but work on reducing landing impact.”).\

* **Report Details & Client Information:**\
  Detailed report sections include:
  * **Report Details:** Date, creator, and client details (Name, Age, Gender, Weight, Height).
  * **Client Details:** Additional contextual information about the client’s performance.

*   **Jump Metrics & Analysis:**\
    The report displays key jump metrics such as:

    * **Jump Height & Flight Duration:** Numerical values including minimum, maximum, and average measurements.
    * **Jump Forces and COM Velocity:** Insights into the dynamics of your jump, compared against normative ranges.
    * **Reactive Strength Index & Normalized Power:** Performance indicators calculated for each jump.

    These metrics are typically displayed as tables and charts, facilitating easy comparison across multiple jumps within the session.

* **Detailed Breakdown by Jump:**\
  For sessions with multiple jumps (e.g., Jump 1, Jump 2, etc.), the report provides per-jump statistics, enabling you to assess consistency and identify areas for improvement.

* **Recommendations Section:**\
  Each metric section is accompanied by generative AI–powered recommendations. For example, you may see targeted advice to adjust your landing technique or improve takeoff power.&#x20;
*   **Actionable Insights:**\
    The final part of the report includes options to:

    * Share the summary.
    * Copy an HTML link for embedding.
    * Download a PDF version of the report.

### Key Metrics and Phases Analyzed

The report analyzes multiple aspects of the vertical jump, including **Power**, **Ground Reaction Force (GRF)**, **Hip Angle**, **Knee Angle**, **Ankle Angle**, and **Hip Height**. Each metric is evaluated across five jumps (Jump 1 to Jump 5) and broken down into distinct phases of the jump cycle:

1. **Body Weight**: Initial resting state before the jump.
2. **Braking**: Deceleration phase as the body prepares to jump.
3. **Zero Velocity**: Moment of transition between downward and upward movement.
4. **Push-Off**: Explosive upward movement to initiate the jump.
5. **Flight**: Airborne phase of the jump.
6. **Landing**: Impact upon returning to the ground.
7. **Damping**: Absorption of landing forces.
8. **Stabilization**: Return to a stable standing position.
